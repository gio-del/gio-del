This project consists of two parts and was realized for the course of "Fundamentals of Operational Research". The goal is to optimize a given problem using Python and in particular Python-MIP. In particular one of the two (the big one) has been evaluated on the base of the time spent in reaching a feasible solution and based on the gap regarding the optimal solution.

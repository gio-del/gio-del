This project was a huge undertaking. Alongside my two colleagues, we built an electric vehicle charging system that makes the charging process a breeze for both drivers and column operators. With the system, drivers can easily locate charging stations on a map, book a charge at a specific time, and even receive tailored charging suggestions based on offers and availability. Meanwhile, column operators have the power to monitor their columns, add new ones, set prices and offers, and control energy usage all while communicating with the hardware that runs the columns via a standard protocol.

We put a lot of effort into creating all the necessary documentation for analyzing requirements and specifications, designing the system and its architecture, external interfaces, and deployment architecture. And finally, we implemented it using React for the frontend and Express.js for the backend.

We also made use of LaTeX, draw.io, and StarUML for documentation and system design, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, React for frontend and Node.js, Express.js for backend. We also used Adminer for database management, Postman for API testing, Docker for deployment, Firebase for cloud push notifications, and postgresql as the database management system.

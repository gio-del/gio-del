This was the biggest project I tackled.

It's a system for electric vehicle charging and it has features for two types of users: drivers and column operators. Drivers can see charging stations on a map, book a charge at a specific time and get charging suggestions based on offers and availability. Column operators have a lot more options like monitoring their columns, adding new ones, setting prices and offers, and controlling energy use and communicating with the hardware that runs the columns.

The goal of this project was to create all the necessary documentation for analyzing requirements and specifications, designing the system and its architecture, external interfaces, and deployment architecture, and finally, implementing it using React for the frontend and Express.js for the backend.
